# Systolic-peak-detection-in-Arterial-Blood-Pressure-waveforms
A MATLAB code which uses gaussian filtering and peak identification algorithms to identify the systolic peaks in ABP waveforms.
The main code: apw_peak_fogd_main.m
The code implements the algorithm on a sample datset. If you have a dataset, please load it into the variable 'a'
